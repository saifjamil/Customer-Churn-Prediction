## Challenges and Limitations in Churn Prediction  

### 1. Class Imbalance  
- **Issue:** Datasets often have significantly fewer churners than non-churners, biasing models toward the majority class.  
- **Solutions:** Resampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning.  
- **Drawbacks:** Risk of overfitting and increased computational costs.  

### 2. Feature Engineering & Data Representation  
- **Challenge:** Integrating diverse data sources (call logs, social media, customer support interactions) is complex.  
- **Deep Learning (DL) Role:** Automates feature extraction but requires extensive preprocessing and computational resources.  

### 3. Model Interpretability  
- **Problem:** DL models (e.g., neural networks) act as "black boxes," unlike interpretable models (Decision Trees, Logistic Regression).  
- **Current Solutions:** Explainable AI techniques (SHAP, attention mechanisms).  
- **Adoption Gap:** These methods are not yet widely used in real-world churn prediction systems.  

### 4. Dynamic Customer Behavior (Concept Drift)  
- **Challenge:** Customer preferences and engagement patterns change over time, reducing model effectiveness.  
- **Potential Fixes:** Adaptive learning (online learning, reinforcement learning).  
- **Limitation:** Requires continuous retraining, making it resource-intensive.  

### 5. Evaluation Metrics vs. Business Impact  
- **Problem:** Traditional metrics (Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC) may not align with business objectives.  
- **Needed Approach:** Profit-driven metrics (e.g., cost of retention vs. lost revenue from churners).  
- **Current State:** Underexplored in research.  

## Future Directions  
- Development of **adaptive, interpretable, and profit-aware models**.  
- Better integration of **real-world deployment constraints** (scalability, efficiency).  
- Emphasis on **cross-domain generalization** and **dynamic learning** to handle concept drift.
